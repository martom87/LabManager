# LabManager
LabManager is an application that helps Lab Managers to better administer their
laboratories. The application facilitates the PubChem based reagents query.
The purchased substances can be signed with an appropriate storage label and saved in the local database. 
The backup copies of the records can then be updated and shared among other research teams members via GoogleDrive.
